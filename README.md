# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

This week my assignment was to create a quiz that included:

* a timer
* multiple choices for each question
* deduction on incorrect answers
* storage of user initials and scores

I had a lot of fun styling the page with Bootstrap. Most if not all mechanics where written in Javascript. 
Using for loops, functions, methods, if statements, arrays, and objects I was able to present the user with 5 questions
and 4 answers to each. When the user selected an answer, they were presented with a new questions and so on. The player is also
able to save their high scores by submitting their initials. Because their scores are saved to local storage they may keep track 
of their progress. Javascript Object Notation played a mayor role in saving the scores for multiple users.
